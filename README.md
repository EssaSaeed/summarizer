### Definition of Done

For all of our development stories:
- Coding standards and style guide is adhered to (place link here)
- All tests pass [on development environment]
- All code to be merged is reviewed by at least one other developer
- All code changes take place on a new "feature branch" that is off of development and gets merged into development
- If a deployment is needed, a rollback strategy is documented and verified
- Architectural decisions and spike results are documented in corresponding README files

Note: This definition of done is not set in stone, it may be updated as needed.
